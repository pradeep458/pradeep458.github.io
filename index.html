      There is an interesting story behind Irani chai's origin in Hyderabad. It
      is said that Persian immigrants came to Mumbai's port in the last century
      and prior to that in search of a better life and to trade. From Mumbai,
      they migrated to Pune and then to Hyderabad. Along with them came the
      concept of Irani chai.

    <p style="width: 50%">
      The story of Assam tea is about being discovered by a Scottish adventurer,
      Robert Bruce, who noticed tea-like plants growing wild near Rangpur. This
      was in 1823 and Bruce was on a trading mission. Bruce was reportedly
      directed by Maniram Dewan to Bessa Gam who was the local Singpho chief.
      Bessa Gam showed Bruce how local tribesmen (known as the Singhpos) brewed
      tea from leaves of this bush. Bruce made an arrangement with the tribal
      chief to give him samples of these tea leaves with seeds, as he planned on
      having them scientifically examined. Robert Bruce passed away a few years
      later, never having seen this plant being properly classified.

    <h2>Benefits of Drinking Tea</h2>
    <img src="/Images/tealove.jpeg" alt="Tea love" />
    <p style="width: 50%">
      Research shows it may be the most effective tea in fighting various forms
      of cancer thanks to its high level of antioxidants. White tea may also be
      good for your teeth since it contains a high source of fluoride, catechins
      and tannins that can strengthen teeth, fight plaque, and make it more
      resistant to acid and sugar.
